# Student Complete Access Portal
Capstone project from my course at Thadomal Shahani Engineering College from Mumbai University’s Bachelors of Engineering in Information Technology. The coursework allowed for all round development as an IT professional and hence the choice to implement any technology-based project for capstone.  

Our decision to develop a web application stems from the combined inclination of all team members in the same direction.

## Description 

• SCAP is a web application developed using HTML, CSS, in the front end and PHP for the backend.

• The core concept of the project was the ability create a unified system for a college to manage student related activities.

• At the core of the project was to perform an analysis on student data to give a rating based on not only his academic records but also his involvement in extracurricular activities.

• Teachers had the option to enter attendance of each class, on the other hand a student could see his attendance percentage thus helping him/her keep a track of it.

• The admin could add teachers and courses and associate it to them. The admin could also put out a notification which would be visible to all other entities in the form of marquee once they login.

## Design & Considerations

• A design model based on Apache tiles framework was implemented. The navigation options for each user were decided dynamically based on role selected at login. 

• The user session was maintained using PhP’s internal session variable.

## Running the application locally

You will need a local server for which you could install WAMP(Windows, Apache, MySQL, PhP). 

You can get the setup here: [WAMP software download]( http://www.wampserver.com/en/)

If on a Linux machine you could alternatively use LAMP(Linux, Apache, MySQL, PhP). 

You can get the setup here: [LAMP software download](https://bitnami.com/stack/lamp/installer)

### You can then run the ‘X’AMP server software and click on start all services. You should now have a running instance of Apache, MySQL and PhP.

### Run the file index.php file.
